## Key Design Principles for Foxhue

### Typography Strategy
Select a distinctive serif for headings (DM Serif Display) paired with a clean sans-serif for body (Inter). This combination signals premium creative capability while maintaining readability for SME audiences. Consistent across website, social media, presentations, and documentation.

### Color Approach
Deep navy primary (#1A1A2E) for authority. Vibrant coral accent (#E94560) for energy and CTAs. Near-white background (#F8F8FA) for breathing room. This palette avoids the beige/neutral trap that many agencies fall into — it's distinctive without being aggressive.

### Motion Philosophy
Subtle, purposeful motion only: smooth scroll transitions, hover reveals on portfolio items, gentle entrance animations. Never decorative — every animation supports narrative flow and user understanding. Follow Stokt and Anyflow's principle: motion as communication, not decoration.

### Case Study Format
For each project: Client challenge → Foxhue's approach → Design evolution → Business results. MARR Laser & Skin Clinic serves as the first case study. Include before/after, strategic rationale, and measurable outcomes where possible.

### Homepage Formula
1. Hero: Bold positioning statement + one compelling visual
2. Services: 6 clear offerings with brief descriptions
3. Featured work: 2-3 case study previews with strong imagery
4. Social proof: Client testimonials or logos
5. CTA: Clear next step (book a call / start a project)

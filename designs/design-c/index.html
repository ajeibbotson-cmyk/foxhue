          <p class="about__text">Based in Bicester, Oxfordshire, we're a small creative studio with over 30 years of combined experience in design, marketing, and brand strategy. We work with small and medium-sized businesses who know that how they present themselves matters &mdash; and who want a creative partner that genuinely cares about getting it right.</p>
          <p class="about__text">We keep our studio small on purpose. It means you always work directly with us, every project gets our full attention, and nothing leaves our hands until we're proud of it. We believe great design should feel effortless to the people who experience it, even though we know how much thought and craft goes into making it that way.</p>
